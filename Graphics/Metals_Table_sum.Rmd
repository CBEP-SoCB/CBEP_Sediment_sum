# Introduction
Casco Bay Estuary Partnership collected sediment samples in 1991, 1994, 2000,
2001, 2002, 2010, and 2011 to look at concentrations of toxic contaminants in
Casco Bay surface Sediments. These studies were complemented by data collected
by under the auspices of EPA's the National Coastal Assessment (NCA) and 
National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA).

Chemicals studied included a number of different metals.  Here we develop a 
narrative table for the State of the Bay Report summarizing results of analysis
of many metals.

                                        Sample_Year = col_double(),

                                        `QA Qualifier` = col_skip(),
                                        Reportable_Result = col_skip(),
                                        ERL = col_double(),
                                        ERM = col_double() )
                      ) %>%
  mutate(Replicate = Replicate == -1) %>%
  mutate(Det_Flag = Det_Flag == 1) %>%
  mutate(nd_flag = ! Det_Flag) %>%
  mutate(Parameter = if_else(Parameter == "Chromium (total)",
                             "Chromium",
                             Parameter))
```

### Change Factor Levels
```{r}
metals_data <- metals_data %>%
  mutate(LVL = factor(LVL, levels = c('Below ERL','Between ERL and ERM',
                                     'Above ERM'))) %>%
  mutate(Region = factor(Region, levels = c("Inner Bay",
                                            "West Bay",
                                            "East Bay",
                                            "Outer Bay",
                                            "Cape Small"))) %>%
  mutate(Era = ordered(Era, levels = c( "1990s", "2010s", "2000s")))
```

## Select Metals to Be Analyzed
We restrict analysis to those metals sampled in all three Eras.
```{r}
xt <- xtabs(~ Parameter + Era, data = metals_data)
rowcount <- apply(xt,1,function(x) sum(x>0,na.rm = TRUE))
selected <- names(rowcount[rowcount>2])

metals_data <- metals_data %>%
  filter(Parameter %in% selected)
rm(selected, xt)
```

## Estimating Non-detects
Using our lognormal maximum likelihood procedure.  We apply this procedure to
the entire data set for each metal at one time, which may bias results if data
should not be considered as being drawn from a single distribution (e.g., if
concentrations are dramatically different in different Regions or Eras).  Because
detection limits are uniformly low, often well below most observed values,
this is likely to have relatively small effect on slope estimates, which are our
focus here.

Note that conditional means associated with rare non-detects often can not be
readily estimated using the existing algorithm, because it requires drawing a
huge sample to get enough samples below the detection limits.

We up the parameter `max_samp` to 5 million in hopes of reducing the number of
times that happens.  That slows this computation so that it takes several
minutes, but even so, we get a few observations where we can not estimate a
conditional mean. (Note that each notification, below, is for a single
observation).  This behavior may be addressed in a future version of the 
LCMeans package.

This is a time-consuming step, so we set cache = true.  That reduces time for 
reknitting the notebook, but does not help when running the notebook
interactively.  An alternative would be to save a version of the data (with
estimated conditional means) after this step, and not recalculate, but that
runs the risk of leaving in outdated data if upstream data is modified.

```{r cache = TRUE}
metals_data <- metals_data %>%
  mutate(val = if_else(nd_flag, MDL, Result)) %>%
  group_by(Parameter) %>%
  mutate(Res_ML = sub_cmeans(val, nd_flag, max_samp = 5*10^6)) %>%
  ungroup(Parameter)
```

# Robust Regression models
We can conduct a robust regression, based on Theil-Sen slope estimators
(actually a slightly more robust estimator by Siegel).

We could not get the following to work inside a pipe or `lapply()` call, so we
fell back on using a loop.  Also, `mblm()` does not like having a log transform
in the model formula, so we had to move the log transform outside the call.

```{r}
mods <-metals_data %>%
  group_by(Parameter) %>%
  nest()

lmods <- list()
for (n in seq_along(mods$Parameter)) {
  metal <- mods$Parameter[n]
  tmp <- metals_data %>%
    filter(Parameter == metal) %>%
    mutate(logval = log(Res_ML)) %>%
    filter(! is.na(Res_ML))
  rlm <- mblm(logval ~ Sample_Year, data = tmp)
  lmods[[metal]] <- rlm
}

mods$rlm <- lmods
rm(lmods, rlm, tmp, metal)
```

## T-S Slopes
```{r}
rlm_slopes <- unlist(lapply(mods$rlm ,function(m) coefficients(m)[[2]]))
names(rlm_slopes) <- mods$Parameter
```

## Check Significance with Kendall's Tau
There is some controversy regarding the appropriateness of different approaches
to estimating statistical significance of these slopes. The default approach
provided in the `mblm` package is not well supported.  Instead, we use the
related Kendall's Tau, which is generally more conservative.

```{r}
mods <- mods %>%
  mutate(tau_test = 
           lapply(data,
                  function(df) cor.test(~ log(Res_ML) + Sample_Year,
                                        data = df,
                                        method = 'kendall')))
```

```{r} 
tau_p_vals = lapply(mods$tau_test, function(t) t$p.value)
names(tau_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter

sig_tau <- names(tau_p_vals[tau_p_vals<0.05])
rlm_slopes[sig_tau]
```
So, we end up with Cadmium showing an increase, Chromium, Lead, and Nickle
declining, and other metals showing no trend.

# Generating a Summary Table of Metals
A graphic for metals will take up too much room in the report, so we want to
generate a table summarizing results for metals.  We want to indicate
"Increasing", "Decreasing", "No Trend" for each metal, and add something about
the fraction of observations exceeding thresholds in 2010.

## Trend Words
```{r}
tau =   unlist(lapply(mods$tau_test, function(t) t$estimate))
tau_words <- with(mods, if_else(! (tau_p_vals < 0.05),
                             "No Trend",
                             if_else(rlm_slopes < 0, 'Decreasing',
                                     'Increasing')))
names(tau_words) <- mods$Parameter
tau_words

```

Remember, we are ONLY working with the metals for which we have data from all
three eras here. Also, we look at the ERL because no metal samples in 2010
exceeded the ERM values.

The categories are defined as follows:
*  Never:  Never observed (frequency = 0)  
*  Rare: < 10%  
*  Uncommon: < 25%  
*  Common: <50%  
*  Frequent > 50%  

```{r}
tab1 <- metals_data %>%
  filter(Era == '2010s') %>%
  group_by(Parameter) %>%
  summarize(has_ERL = any(! is.na(ERL)),
            num  = sum(! is.na(Result)),
            num_exceeds = sum(Result > ERL, na.rm = TRUE),
            pct_exceeds = round(num_exceeds/num,3)*100,
            labs = cut(pct_exceeds,
                       c(-0.1, 0.1, 10,25, 50, 110),
                       labels = c('Never',
                                      'Rare',
                                      'Uncommon',
                                      'Common',
                                      'Frequent')),
            `Exceeds ERLâ€ ` = if_else(has_ERL, as.character(labs), 'No ERL')) %>%
  select(-has_ERL, -num, -num_exceeds, -pct_exceeds, -labs)
tab1
```
Now, we want to do something similar, adding a columns indicating the direction
of any SIGNIFICANT slope estimates to the table.  We already worked these out
based on the linear regression models, above.

Here's the code, slightly modified, to avoid a long-distance dependency in the
R Notebook that could prove confusing.

```{r}
is_sign   <- unlist(lapply(mods$rlm,function(m) summary(m)$coefficients[2,4] < 0.025))
decreasing <- unlist(lapply(mods$rlm,function(m) coefficients(m)[2] < 0))

tab2 <- tibble(Parameter = mods$Parameter,
               is_sign   = is_sign,
               is_decreasing = decreasing,
               'Trend' = if_else(! is_sign, 'No Trend',
                              if_else(is_decreasing,
                                      'Decreasing','Increasing'))) %>%
  select(-is_sign, -is_decreasing)
```

And last, lets identify whether there are significant differences among Regions.

## Region Model
```{r}
mods <- mods %>%
  mutate(region_anova = lapply(data,
                      function(df) lm(log(Res_ML) ~ Region, data = df)))
```

Here we pull the p value from the ANOVA table, rather than the summary, because
we want to an overall test for inequality across all regions.  'summary.lm()` 
provides an array, but `anova.lm()` produces a data frame, with non-syntactic
variable names.

See `Metals_Analysis_sum.Rmd` for more in-depth look at methods and assumptions.

```{r} 
region_p_vals = lapply(mods$region_anova, function(t) anova(t)$`Pr(>F)`[1])
names(region_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter

(sig_region <- names(region_p_vals[region_p_vals<0.025]))

```

So almost all metals show differences by region.

### Examine Pairwise Comparisons
In `Metals_Analysis~3.Rmd`, we used the related `pwpp()` function for a
graphical depiction of pairwise comparisons.  We skip that here to save space.
We use `emmeans()` to pull out pairwise comparisons in a nice summary form.

```{r}
compare <- list()
for (n in seq_along(mods$Parameter)) {
  metal <- mods$Parameter[n]
  compare[[metal]] <- emmeans(mods$region_anova[[n]],
                              ~ Region)
}
mods$region_emm <- compare
rm(metal, compare)

for (n in seq_along(mods$Parameter)) {
  cat('\n---------------------', mods$Parameter[n], '---------------------\n')
  print(mods$region_emm[[n]])
}
```

### Hand-generated comparison text
We could not figure out an easy way to generate a summary description of the
pairwise comparisons, so we generated text by hand, and read them into a data
frame here so we can access them later to construct a table.

```{r}
tab3 <- tribble(
~Parameter     , ~`Comparison of Regions`,
'Arsenic'    , 'Cape Small is low.',
'Cadmium'    , 'Outer Bay is low;  Cape Small is even lower.',
'Chromium'   , 'Cape Small is lower than East Bay and West Bay.',
'Copper'     , 'Outer Bay is low; Cape Small even lower.',
'Iron'       , 'Cape Small is lower than East Bay and West Bay.',
'Lead'       , 'Cape Small is low;  Inner Bay is high.',
'Mercury'    , 'Cape Small < Outer Bay and West Bay < East Bay < Inner Bay',
'Nickel'     , 'Cape Small is low.',
'Selenium'   , 'No differences.',
'Silver'     , 'Cape Small is low; Inner Bay is high.',
'Zinc'       , 'Cape Small is low. Outer Bay lower than inner Bay.')
```

```{r}
tab <- tab1 %>% left_join(tab2)  %>% left_join(tab3) %>%
  rename(Metal = Parameter)
```

```{r}
cap = 'â€  Rare: < 10%; Uncommon: < 25%; Common: <50%, Frequent > 50%'
knitr::kable(tab, caption = cap)
```
