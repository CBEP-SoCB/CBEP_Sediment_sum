# Introduction
Casco Bay Estuary Partnership collected sediment samples in 1991, 1994, 2000,
2001, 2002, 2010, and 2011 to look at concentrations of toxic contaminants in
Casco Bay surface Sediments. These studies were complemented by data collected
by under the auspices of EPA's the National Coastal Assessment (NCA) and 
National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA).

Chemicals studied included metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, dioxins and furans,
and organotins.  These contaminants are all persistent in the marine
environment.


## Sample Locations
The original (1991) sampling locations were selected by an expert group by
placing dots on a map of Casco Bay to get sample locations distributed evenly in
areas known to not have rocky substrate (and where, therefore, soft sediment
samples could be collected).  Originally, each location was given a location
code, of the form "XX##", where "XX" is a two letter region code, and "##" is a
two digit sequence number.

An effort was made in subsequent years to sample the same locations, but for a
variety of reasons, samples were not always collected in quite the same
locations. In the Early 2010s, CBEP staff realized sample locations were
recorded inconsistently, and made a concerted effort to identify where each
sample had actually been collected, often by going back to paper field data
sheets associated with sampling events. 

A large fraction, but not all, observations were collected within a
hundred meters or so of nominal original (1991) sample locations. We grouped
sample locations into Locations (clusters of samples within about 100m of the
original sampling locations), assigning new Location Codes as needed.  Within
Locations we assigned Substations (within the resolution of the GPS equipment
used at the time, typically ~ 5 to 10 meters, which is smaller than expected
drift during sample collection.).  

To simplify data analysis and visualization, samples are "binned" into five
major subregions of the Bay, as follows

(descriptions from 2017 Ramboll Environ  report to CBEP):

> Inner Bay: The Inner Bay includes the western most part of Casco Bay,
encompassing the Fore River and Presumpscot River estuaries. The cities of
Portland and South Portland and the towns of Falmouth and Yarmouth are located
within its drainage.

> Outer Bay: The Outer Bay includes the large open water area to the south of
the other regions. It represents the area that connects Casco Bay to the rest of
the Gulf of Maine.

> West Bay: West Bay extends from Yarmouth on the west to Orrs and Bailey
Islands on the east. It includes Maquoit and Middle Bays, Harpswell Sound, and
the communities of Freeport, Harpswell, and parts of southern Brunswick. The
Royal and Harraseeket Rivers discharge into West Bay.

> East Bay: East Bay includes the inland portions of Casco Bay bordered by Orrs
and Bailey Islands on the west and Phippsburg on the east. It includes Quahog
Bay and the New Meadows River in southern Brunswick and Phippsburg.

> Cape Small: Cape Small is the easternmost region of the bay. It includes the
southern end of the Phippsburg peninsula to Small Point. The mouth of the Lower
Kennebec River flows into the Gulf of Maine to the east of Phippsburg. While it
is not part of Casco Bay, coastal circulation patterns indicate that the
discharge from the Lower Kennebec (which includes flows from the Kennebec and
Androscoggin Rivers) is entrained into the bay in the Cape Small area (Janzen et
al. 2005).

### Add the "Era" variable

sedtox_data <- sedtox_data %>%
  mutate(Era = (Sample_Year-1990) %/% 10)%>%
  mutate(Era = factor(Era, labels = c('1990s', '2000s', '2010s')))

  mutate(Era = (Sample_Year-1990) %/% 10)%>%
  mutate(Era = factor(Era, labels = c('1990s', '2000s', '2010s')))
```

# Examine Data Structure
## Categories Sampled Each Year
```{r}
xtabs(~Sample_Year + Parameter_Group, data = sedtox_data)
```
The category "Radio" includes only measurement of Uranium-238, not otherwise
studied, so of little value.  We don't track it further.

## Parameters and Parameter Groups
```{r}
the_order <- as.numeric(factor(sedtox_data$Parameter_Group))

tmp <- sedtox_data %>%
  mutate(Parameter = factor(Parameter,
                            levels = levels(fct_reorder(sedtox_data$Parameter, the_order))))
                                                 
knitr::kable(xtabs(~Parameter + Parameter_Group, data = tmp))
rm(tmp)
```

Note that parameters include totals and sums.  But, confusingly, not all sums
included here were (re)calculated in the Access database Sums table.  Some
must pre-date Ramboll's work.  

# Units
```{r}
xtabs(~Era + Parameter_Group  + Units, data = sedtox_data)
```

Note that metals are in $\mu g/g$ or ppm, organics are in $n g/g$ or ppb, or
(for dioxins and furans) in ng/kg, or parts per trillion (ppt is ambiguous, but
usually refers to parts per trillion).  Physical observations are generally in 
percent.

# Subdivide Data By Parameter Group
It is worth separating by Parameter Group into smaller, more manageable
data sets.  We could have done this more compactly with lapply, but by
repeating code, we could specify file names simply and directly. 

```{r}
diox_data   <- sedtox_data %>% filter(Parameter_Group == 'CDDF')
metals_data <- sedtox_data %>% filter(Parameter_Group == 'Inorganic')
tbt_data    <- sedtox_data %>% filter(Parameter_Group == 'Organotin')
pah_data    <- sedtox_data %>% filter(Parameter_Group == 'PAH')
pcb_data    <- sedtox_data %>% filter(Parameter_Group == 'PCB')
pest_data   <- sedtox_data %>% filter(Parameter_Group == 'Pesticide')
phys_data   <- sedtox_data %>% filter(Parameter_Group == 'Physical')
```

The challenge we have with many of these smaller data sets will be extracting
meaning in a simple way. We have far too many parameters to include in the
Chapter in anything but a confusing way.  This particular data presentation
includes both individual parameters and sums, so we need to extract information
one parameter at a time, not do blind sums by parameter groups.

Unfortunately, the list of parameters actually obscures which are sums and
which are field measurements of mixtures.

# Check for Other Sums and Totals in the Data
## The "Official" Totals
Ramboll Calculated the following "Official" Totals, which  

1. Should be in the dataset, and  
2. Are easy to remove because we have a complete list. 
```{r}
xtabs(~ Parameter + Parameter_Group , data = sums_data)
```

## Checking All Data Subsets
We look at each of the data subsets to identify "totals" and sums that are in
the original data, but do not represent original observations. We do this simply
by examining the list of parameters in each group.

### Butyl Tin Totals
```{r}
xtabs(~ Parameter + Parameter_Group , data = tbt_data)
```
Only a single total, which is the "official" total recalculated by Ramboll.

### Dioxin Totals
```{r}
xtabs(~ Parameter + Parameter_Group , data = diox_data)
```
The only "Official" Dioxin-related total is
*  CDD/CDF (total)

A small number of samples (17) include other values flagged as (total). 
*  HpCDD (total)
*  HpCDF (total)
*  HxCDD (total)
*  HxCDF (total)
*  PeCDD (total)
*  PeCDF (total)
*  TCDD (total)
*  TCDF (total)

Three other items turn up in 62 samples.  They are not labeled as totals,
and they refer to specific tetra- penta- and hexa- chlorobiphenyls.  
(note that these are listed under `Parameter_Group == "CDDF"`, NOT 
`Parameter_Group == "PCB"`.)
*  PCB-077 (3,3',4,4'-TeCB) (dioxin-like)  
*  PCB-126 (3,3',4,4',5-PeCB) (dioxin-like)  
*  PCB-169 (3,3',4,4',5,5'-HxCB) (dioxin-like)  

It is probably not an accident that the sum of 62 + 17 = 79, which appears to
be the total number of samples.

Reviewing the full list of parameters, None of these appear to be sums. 

HpCDD, for example, refers to Heptachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin, which occurs in a
number of isomers, which are chemically difficult to distinguish in samples.  
The "(total)" here appears to refer to a total of multiple (analytically 
indistinguishable) isomers.  NO other HpCDD appears in the parameter list,
so this can not be a sum of other anylates.

A quick check suggest we are looking at differences in reporting from different
years.  The 17 samples with `HpCDD (total)` and its cousins are all from 2010.

```{r}
selected <- c('HpCDD (total)', "PCB-077 (3,3',4,4'-TeCB) (dioxin-like)")
diox_data %>%
  select(Sample_ID, Sample_Year, Method, Parameter, Result) %>%
  filter(Parameter %in% selected) %>%
  pivot_wider(c(Sample_ID, Sample_Year, Method), names_from = Parameter, values_from = Result)
```

### Conclusion
Remaining "Totals" are NOT sums that we should remove.

## Metals Data Totals 
```{r}
xtabs(~ Parameter + Parameter_Group , data = metals_data)
```
No Totals.  "Chromium (total) refers to measuring all oxidation states of
chromium, not a sum of other observations.

## PAH Data Totals
```{r}
xtabs(~ Parameter + Parameter_Group , data = pah_data)
```

So under PAHs, we have six totals,

The following PAH Totals are NOT included in the "official" totals, and 
should be removed from the data:

*  PAHs (High MW 13)  
*  PAHs (Low MW 9)  
*  PAHs (total 22)  

## PCB Data Totals
```{r}
xtabs(~ Parameter + Parameter_Group , data = pcb_data)
```

Here the only total is the "official" total, so we are probably O.K.  It is
not clear how we should handle the three "(unidentified PCBs)".

## Pesticides Data Totals
```{r}
xtabs(~ Parameter + Parameter_Group , data = pest_data)
```
The three totals here  
*  Chlordane (total) 
*  DDT+DDE+DDD (sum)  
*  Pesticides (total) 
are all "official" totals.

## Physical Data Totals
```{r}
xtabs(~ Parameter + Sample_Year , data = phys_data)
```

None of the parameters here with 'Total' in the names are sums, however, some 
of the OTHER values represent sums calculated before the data was submitted to
Ramboll.

*  **Percent Silt and Clay** is (almost always) a sum of separate silt and clay
   values. However, seven 2000 samples, one 2002 sample and seven 2010 samples
   only have "Percent Sand" and "Percent Silt and Clay" values.
*  Sand was subdivided into more precise sand fractions only in 2010 and 2011.
   **Percent Sand** in those two years was USUALLY a SUM of the other sand
   fractions , except for  seven samples from the NCCA from 2010.
*  **Percent Total Grain Size** was a QA/QC check testing whether the sum of all 
   grain size data sums to one (or close to it). 
   
Note that "Percent Gravel" was inconsistently reported, making it unclear
whether all other grain size fractions are comparable, at least for the handful
of sites with high gravel.

These sums probably need to be removed and recalculated, without removing the
data associated with samples where we have no finer-scale data.

### Checks on sums and totals
#### Silt And Clay Totals
Silt Clay is consistently EITHER the sum of other silt and clay values
or a measurement where silt and clay values are not also available.
```{r}
phys_data %>%
  filter(Parameter != 'Organic Carbon (total)') %>%
  filter(Parameter != 'Solids (total)') %>%
  group_by(Sample_ID) %>%
  summarize(year = first(Sample_Year),
         sand = sum(grepl('Sand', Parameter) * Result),
         silt = sum((grepl('Silt', Parameter) & ! grepl('Clay', Parameter)) * 
                      Result),
         clay = sum((grepl('Clay', Parameter) & ! grepl('Silt', Parameter)) *
                      Result),
         siltclay = sum((Parameter == "Percent Silt and Clay") *
                          Result),
         test = siltclay - (silt + clay) < 0.01 | (silt == 0 & clay == 0),
         .groups = 'drop')
```

We can selectively remove "Silt + Clay" values that are sums of other variables
as follows:
```{r}
phys_data %>%
  filter(Parameter != 'Organic Carbon (total)') %>%
  filter(Parameter != 'Solids (total)') %>%
  group_by(Sample_ID) %>%
  mutate(silt = sum((grepl('Silt', Parameter) & ! grepl('Clay', Parameter)) * 
                      Result),
         clay = sum((grepl('Clay', Parameter) & ! grepl('Silt', Parameter)) *
                      Result),
         test = ! (silt == 0 & clay == 0)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter( ! (Parameter == 'Percent Silt and Clay' & test)) %>%
  select(-silt, -clay, -test)
```

#### Sand Totals
Here's a quick way to find the samples from 2010 and 2011 we do NOT want to change.
```{r}
phys_data %>%
  filter(Sample_Year > 2009, grepl("NCCA", Sample_ID)) %>%
  arrange(Parameter)

```

So we can invert that and add a filter for the parameter, and find the data 
rows we want to delete.
```{r}
phys_data %>%
  filter(Sample_Year > 2009,
         ! grepl("NCCA", Sample_ID),
         Parameter == 'Percent Sand')
```

Note that we found 75 values, exactly what we would expect based on sample
frequencies in the cross-tabs, above.

Lets check those sites to make sure the "Percent Sand" value really is a sum.
```{r}
phys_data %>%
  filter(Sample_Year > 2009) %>%
  group_by(Sample_ID) %>%
  summarize(sand = sum((grepl('Sand', Parameter) & ! Parameter == 'Percent Sand') * 
                      Result),
         total = sum((Parameter == 'Percent Sand') * 
                      Result),
         test =  abs(total - sand) < 0.001,
         .groups = 'drop')
```
It is.

## Total Grain Size
Percent Total Grain Size was not calculated for all samples, and appears to
Include the Gravel Fraction.  It should be removed from the data as inconsistent
and possibly misleading.

```{r}
unique(phys_data$Parameter)
```


```{r}
phys_data %>%
  filter(Parameter != 'Organic Carbon (total)') %>%
  filter(Parameter != 'Solids (total)') %>%
  group_by(Sample_ID) %>%
  summarize(year = first(Sample_Year),
         sand = sum(grepl('Sand', Parameter) * Result),
         siltclay = sum((Parameter == "Percent Silt and Clay") *
                          Result),
         gravel = sum((Parameter == 'Percent Gravel') * Result),
         total = sum((Parameter == 'Percent Total Grain Size') * Result),
         test = abs(total + gravel - 100) < 0.1,
         .groups = 'drop')
         
```

```{r}
phys_data %>%
  filter(Parameter != 'Organic Carbon (total)') %>%
  filter(Parameter != 'Solids (total)') %>%
  filter(Sample_ID == 'CBEP2010-WB08')
```

The inconsistent reporting of the Gravel Fraction makes it impossible to be sure
how to interpret the sand and silt/sand fractions for all samples.  Best
practice here may be to recalculate those values based on the gravel-free
fraction.  We test that idea here.

```{r}
phys_data %>%
  group_by(Sample_ID, Replicate) %>%
  summarize(year = first(Sample_Year),
         total = sum(grepl('Percent Total Grain Size', Parameter) * Result),
         total2 = sum(Result) - 
           sum((Parameter == 'Percent Gravel') * Result ) -
           sum((Parameter == 'Percent Silt') * Result ) -
           sum((Parameter == 'Percent Clay') * Result ),
         gravel = sum((Parameter == 'Percent Gravel') * Result),
         .groups = 'drop')
```

That points out that ZERO values here are "really" NAs.  

# Examine Structure of Sums Data
```{r}
xtabs(~Era + Parameter_Group, data = sums_data)
```

# Parameters and Parameter Groups
```{r}
the_order <- as.numeric(factor(sums_data$Parameter_Group))

tmp <- sums_data %>%
  mutate(Parameter = factor(Parameter,
                            levels = levels(fct_reorder(Parameter, the_order))))
                                                 
knitr::kable(xtabs(~Parameter + Parameter_Group, data = tmp))
rm(tmp)
```

Those look pretty convenient for comparison purposes.

**The metadata is not entirely clear, but it appears (from examining the Access
database) that these sums omit non-detects, effectively equating non-detects to
zero. That is inconsistent with how we  handled non-detects in several other
toxics data sets, where we have been using maximum likelihood estimators of
expected values.**

# Units
```{r}
xtabs(~Era + Parameter_Group  + Units, data = sums_data)
```

Ramboll Standardized units in the Access database, so, MOST sums are expressed
in ng/g dry weight (~ ppb). 

The Dioxins and Furans are expressed in ng/kg, or pg/g or approximately parts
per trillion.  There are no Squirts for Dioxins and Furans.  Instead, Ramboll
ALSO expressed them in TEQ -- Tox equivalents.  Toxic equivalents provide a way
to estimate the cumulative toxic effect of a mixture of related chemicals by 
weighting each compound by its relative toxic effect, compared to some reference
compound (conventionally TCDD).

# Load SQuiRTs Data
We compare those totals to the SQuiRTs, when available. Ramboll Environ's Access
database again contains a table derived from the SQuiRTs, containing ERL
(Effects Range Low)  and ERM (Effects Range Medium) values for selected
parameters.

```{r load_squirts}
fn <- "SQuiRTs.xlsx"
squirts_data <- read_excel(file.path(sibling,fn), 
    col_types = c("skip", "text", "text", 
        "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
        "numeric", "numeric", "text", "skip"))
```

## Units
We need to ensure that we are using similar units for analysis and comparison
to the SQuiRTs.  The SQuiRTs Table contains two different sets of values,
with different units.  We want to check both.

```{r}
xtabs(~ Param_Norm + Units_org , data = squirts_data)
xtabs(~ Param_Norm + Units_fin, data = squirts_data)
```
So, SQuiRTs are originally in ppb, but Ramboll Environ converted units to
µg/g dry or ng/g dry, consistent with the way concentrations were also reported.
