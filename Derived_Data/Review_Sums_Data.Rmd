# Introduction
Casco Bay Estuary Partnership collected sediment samples in 1991, 1994, 2000,
2001, 2002, 2010, and 2011 to look at concentrations of toxic contaminants in
Casco Bay surface Sediments. These studies were complemented by data collected
by under the auspices of EPA's the National Coastal Assessment (NCA) and 
National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA).

Chemicals studied included metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, dioxins and furans,
and organotins.  These contaminants are all persistent in the marine
environment.

                                        ERL = col_double(),
                                        ERM = col_double() )
                      ) %>%
  mutate(Replicate = Replicate == -1)
```

# Examine Structure of Sums Data
```{r}
xtabs(~Parameter + Era, data = sums_data)
```
But MANY of those observations are zeros, because of high detection limits in 
the last couple of years.  Those appear in these data as NAs:
```{r}
xtabs(~Parameter + Era, data = sums_data, subset = ! is.na(Result))
```

So non-detects are a real problem for Pesticides, PCBs, and Butyltins in 2000
and 2001.

**The metadata is not entirely clear, but it appears (from examining the Access
database) that these sums omit non-detects, effectively equating non-detects to
zero. That is inconsistent with how we  handled non-detects in several other
toxics data sets, where we have been using maximum likelihood estimators of
expected values.**

# Units
```{r}
xtabs(~Parameter  + Era + Units , data = sums_data)
```
Ramboll Standardized units in the Access database, so, MOST sums are expressed
in ng/g dry weight (~ ppb). 

The Dioxins and Furans are expressed in ng/kg, or pg/g or approximately parts
per trillion.  

There are no Squirts for Dioxins and Furans.  Instead, Ramboll
ALSO expressed them in TEQ -- Tox equivalents.  Toxic equivalents provide a way
to estimate the cumulative toxic effect of a mixture of related chemicals by 
weighting each compound by its relative toxic effect, compared to some reference
compound (conventionally TCDD).
