# Introduction
Casco Bay Estuary Partnership collected sediment samples in 1991, 1994, 2000,
2001, 2002, 2010, and 2011 to look at concentrations of toxic contaminants in
Casco Bay surface Sediments. These studies were complemented by data collected
by under the auspices of EPA's the National Coastal Assessment (NCA) and 
National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA).

Chemicals studied included metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, dioxins and furans,
and organotins.  These contaminants are all persistent in the marine
environment.

### Sums Data Caveates
See the "Review_Data.Rmd" and "Review_Sums_Data.Rmd" files for details.

Sums are defined in Table 4 of the Ramboll report, available in the "2017 Casco
Bay Sediment Report Tables FINAL.xlsx" file in the "Original_Data" folder, and
(implicitly) in the "SumGroups.xlsx" file in the same folder.

**The metadata is not entirely clear, but it appears (from examining the Access
database) that these sums omit non-detects, effectively equating non-detects to
zero. That is inconsistent with how we  handled non-detects in several other
toxics data sets, where we have been using maximum likelihood estimators of
expected values.**

Because of different analytic methods used in different years, sums include a
relatively small consistent subset of parameters, so they may not be fully
compatible with available benchmarks.

Many observations from 2010 and 2011 are zeros or NAs, because of high detection
limits. This is especially  problem for data on Pesticides, PCBs, and Butyltins
in 2010 and 2011.  Effectively, we have no data on PCBs and Pesticides, and very
little data on Butyltins from 2010 and 2011.

Ramboll Standardized units in the Access database, so, most sums are expressed
in ng/g dry weight (~ ppb). The Dioxins and Furans are expressed in ng/kg, or
pg/g or approximately parts per trillion.  

There are no SQuiRTs for Dioxins and Furans. Instead, Ramboll also expressed
them in TEQ -- Tox equivalents.  Toxic equivalents provide a way to estimate the
cumulative toxic effect of a mixture of related chemicals by weighting each
compound by its relative toxic effect, compared to some reference compound
(conventionally TCDD).


### Change Factor Levels
```{r}
sums_data <- sums_data %>%

  mutate(Parameter = factor(Parameter,
                            levels = c(
                              "Butyltin (mono+di+tri)",
                              "CDD/CDF (total)",
                              "Chlordane (total)",
                              "DDT+DDE+DDD (sum)",
                              "PAHs (High MW)",
                              "PAHs (Low MW)",
                              "PAHs (total)",
                              "PCBs (total)",
                              "Pesticides (total)"),
                            labels = c("Butyltins",
                                       "Dioxins and Furans",
                                       "Chlordanes",
                                       "DDT Residues",
                                       "High MW PAHs",
                                       "Low MW PAHs",
                                       "Total PAHs",
                                       "Total PCBs",
                                       "Pesticides"))) %>%
  mutate(LVL = factor(LVL, levels = c('Below ERL','Between ERL and ERM',
                                     'Above ERM'))) %>%
  mutate(Region = factor(Region, levels = c("Inner Bay",
                                            "West Bay",
                                            "East Bay",
                                            "Outer Bay",
                                            "Cape Small")))
```

### Delete Unused Parameters
To simplify presentation for State of Casco Bay, we will not report all totals.
we remove unused data here.
```{r}
sums_data <- sums_data %>%
  filter(! Parameter %in% c("Chlordanes", "High MW PAHs",
                            "Low MW PAHs", "Pesticides")) %>%
  mutate(Parameter = factor(Parameter,
                            levels = c("Butyltins",
                                       "Dioxins and Furans",
                                       "DDT Residues",
                                       "Total PAHs",
                                       "Total PCBs")))
```


# Preliminary Trend Graphic
```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
sums_data %>%

  mutate(Parameter = factor(Parameter,
                            levels = c("Total PAHs", "Total PCBs",
                                       "DDT Residues", "Dioxins and Furans",
                                       "Butyltins"))) %>%
  mutate(Result = if_else(Parameter == "Dioxins and Furans",
                          Result/1000,
                          Result)) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = Sample_Year, y = Result)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = LVL), size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE, color = cbep_colors()[3],
              lwd = 0.5, lty = 2) +
  
  scale_y_log10(labels=scales::comma) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1990, 2000, 2010)) +
  scale_color_manual(name = '', values = cbep_colors(), na.value = "firebrick",
                     labels = c('Below ERL','Between ERL and ERM',
                                     'Above ERM', "No Reference Defined")) +
  
  facet_wrap(~Parameter, ncol = 5) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +

  ylab('Concentration (ppb)') +
  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.25, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom',
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, size = 0.25))
```

# Statistical Significance of Linear Trends
```{r}
mods <-sums_data %>%
  group_by(Parameter) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(mod = lapply(data,
                      function(df) lm(log(Result) ~ Sample_Year, data = df)))
```

```{r}
mods$Parameter
lapply(mods$mod,summary)
```
SO, all are highly statistically significant, except the DDT residues total.

```{r}
cat(paste(as.character(mods$Parameter), collapse = '   ...   '))
cat('\n')
lapply(mods$mod,plot)
```

The model diagnostic plots are not great poor, for several of these models, but
not dreadful. Given high levels of statistical significance, the model
violations are probably not material, but a more careful analysis might explore
larger model spaces or use bootstraps or permutation tests.

# Ordered Factor Analysis by Decade
We can also simplify the model to examine a linear trend by decade, but results
are generally similar.
```{r}
mods2 <-sums_data %>%
  mutate(Era = ordered(Era, levels = c("1990s", "2000s", "2010s"))) %>%
  group_by(Parameter) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(mod = lapply(data,
                      function(df) lm(log(Result) ~ Era, data = df)))

```

```{r}
mods2$Parameter
lapply(mods2$mod,summary)
```
So, results are broadly similar.  Note that PAHs show a significant quadratic,
but not linear trend. Unfortunately, if anything, the diagnostic plots are
worse, not better.

```{r}
mods2$Parameter
lapply(mods2$mod,plot)
```
