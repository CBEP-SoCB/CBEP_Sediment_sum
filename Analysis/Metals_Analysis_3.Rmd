# Introduction
Casco Bay Estuary Partnership collected sediment samples in 1991, 1994, 2000,
2001, 2002, 2010, and 2011 to look at concentrations of toxic contaminants in
Casco Bay surface Sediments. These studies were complemented by data collected
by under the auspices of EPA's the National Coastal Assessment (NCA) and 
National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA).

Chemicals studied included metals. Here we analyze long-term trends in metals.
We use linear models only.

We do not follow the exact analyses conducted by Ramboll, as we recalculate 
estimates based on maximum likelihood estimates of non-detects.  Non-detects are 
relatively rare, except for Selenium and Mercury.


1.  We start with linear regression models on log-transformed data, but model
    diagnostics are not great, making assessment of statistical significance
    problematic.
2.  We examine alternative models that may address some shortcomings
    of linear models in this context, including robust (Theil-Sen) regressions
    (more correctly, median-based linear models).
3.  We  explore linear mixed models, controlling for repeat samples by
    locations.  We model both by year (a quantitative metric) and by "Era",
    which is an ordered factor. These models identify more nominally significant
    trends than models that do not incorporate information on sampling
    locations.
4.  We do not explore Generalized Linear Models based on more 
    highly skewed data.

Unfortunately, the results depend somewhat on the model we select. Long term
trends are clearest in the regression models. We report results in State of
Casco Bay based on the robust regression models. These are robust alternatives 
to the linear regression models used by Ramboll, and thus provide similar
results to what they reported.

```


### Units
See the "Review_Data.Rmd" for details.

Ramboll Standardized units in the Access database, so, concentrations of metals
are expressed in $\mu g/g$ dry weight (~ ppm).

## Change Factor Levels
```{r}
metals_data <- metals_data %>%
  mutate(LVL = factor(LVL, levels = c('Below ERL','Between ERL and ERM',
                                     'Above ERM'))) %>%
  mutate(Region = factor(Region, levels = c("Inner Bay",
                                            "West Bay",
                                            "East Bay",
                                            "Outer Bay",
                                            "Cape Small"))) %>%
  mutate(Era = ordered(Era, levels = c( "1990s",  "2000s", "2010s")))
```


### Select which Metals to Analyze
```{r}
(xt <- xtabs(~ Parameter + Era, data = metals_data))
```

### Remove Data on Metals We will Not Analyze
We restrict analysis to those metals sampled in all three Eras.
```{r}
rowcount <- apply(xt,1,function(x) sum(x>0))
selected <- names(rowcount[rowcount>2])

metals_data <- metals_data %>%
  filter(Parameter %in% selected)
rm(selected)
```

## Estimating Non-detects
Using our lognormal maximum likelihood procedure.  We apply this procedure to
the entire data set for each metal at one time, which may bias results if data
should not be considered as being drawn from a single distribution (e.g., if
concentrations are dramatically different in different Regions or Eras).  Because
detection limits are uniformly low, often well below most observed values,
this is likely to have relatively small effect on slope estimates, which are our
focus here.

Note that conditional means associated with rare non-detects often can not be
readily estimated using the existing algorithm, because it requires drawing a
huge sample to get enough samples below the detection limits.

We up the parameter "max_samp" to 5 million in hopes of reducing the number of
times that happens.  That slows this computation so that it takes several
minutes, but even so, we get a few observations where we can not estimate a
conditional mean. (Note that each notification, below, is for a single
observation).  This behavior may be addressed in a future version of the 
LCMeans package.

This is a time-consuming step, so we set cache = true.  That reduces time for 
reknitting the notebook, but does not help when running the notebook
interactively.  An alternative would be to save a version of the data (with
estimated conditional means) after this step, and not recalculate, but that
runs the risk of leaving in outdated data if upstream data is modified.
```{r cache = TRUE}
metals_data <- metals_data %>%
  mutate(val = if_else(nd_flag, MDL, Result)) %>%
  group_by(Parameter) %>%
  mutate(Res_ML = sub_cmeans(val, nd_flag, max_samp = 5*10^6)) %>%
  ungroup(Parameter)
```

### Demonstrate That Worked
```{r}
ggplot(metals_data, aes(val, Res_ML, color = nd_flag)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap('Parameter', scales = 'free') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

# Utility function
This is convenient for summarizing multiple models using `lapply`.  Not currently
used, but handy during data exploration.
```{r}
 mod_rev <- function(nm, m) {
 for (n in seq_along(m)) {
   cat("-------------------------------------\n")
   cat(nm[[n]], '\n')
   print(anova(m[[n]]))
   print(summary(m[[n]]))
   }
 }
```

# Plot All Metals
```{r}
metals_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sample_Year, Res_ML)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = Det_Flag), width = 0.1, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()[2:3]) +
  facet_wrap('Parameter', scales = 'free_y') +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
  
```

```{r}
metals_data %>%
  ggplot(aes( y = Res_ML, group = Era)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap('Parameter', scales = 'free_y') +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```
Note the wide variation....

# Linear Regression
On log-transformed data.
```{r}
mods <-metals_data %>%
  group_by(Parameter) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(lr_mod = lapply(data,
                      function(df) lm(log(Res_ML) ~ Sample_Year, data = df)))
```

## Identify Significant Regressions
From the log-linear models.  We use P < 0.025 because of relatively poor model
diagnostics.  We don't want to trust "borderline" P values, and we don't want to
go to the trouble (for this purpose) of using bootstraps or other methods to
assess confidence limits more rigorously.
```{r}
lm_p_vals <- lapply(mods$lr_mod ,function(m) summary(m)$coefficients[2,4])
names(lm_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter
```

So, statistically significant regressions include the following
```{r}
sig_lms <- names(lm_p_vals[lm_p_vals<0.025])
sig_lms
```
(Note that Cadmium and Silver show  POSITIVE trends if you run this
analysis on the raw `Result`. That analysis is in error, as a "non-detect"
IS data, just not fully quantified data.  In essence, using `Result` drops
all NDs from the analysis, which tends to bias  results by omitting values that 
we know are low, simply because we don't know HOW low they are.

## Significant Slopes
Lets look at the Parameters of significant regressions.
```{r}
lm_slopes <- lapply(mods$lr_mod ,function(m) coefficients(m)[[2]])
names(lm_slopes) <- mods$Parameter
lm_slopes[lm_p_vals<0.025]
```
All metals with significant trends are decreasing. Ramboll wrote about Selenium,
pointing to what they saw as a POSITIVE slope, but their analysis omitted
non-detects.  But because of the strong non-normal distribution of the selenium
data, and because the selenium data from 2010 and 2011 had a very different 
distribution from earlier observations, we don't believe either analysi..

## Model Diagnostic Plots
```{r}
oldpar <- par()
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
paste(as.character(mods$Parameter[lm_p_vals<0.05]), collapse = '   ...   ')
lapply(mods$lr_mod[lm_p_vals<0.05],plot)
par(oldpar)
```

The model diagnostic plots are not great for most of these models, but
not dreadful, except for Selenium, where the large number of NDs is a serious
problem. The biggest problem is that the data (even after transformation)
is not normally distributed, generally with heavy tails. We should not take
reported p values too seriously.

# Robust Regression
We can conduct a robust regression, based on Theil-Sen (actually Seigal) slope 
estimators, or (nearly equivalently) Kendall's Tau.

We could not get the following to work inside a pipe or `lapply()` call, so we
fell back on using a loop.  Also, `mblm()` does not like having a log transform
in the model formula, so we had to move the log transform outside the call.
```{r}
lmods <- list()
for (n in seq_along(mods$lr_mod)) {
  metal <- mods$Parameter[n]
  tmp <- metals_data %>%
    filter(Parameter == metal) %>%
    mutate(logval = log(Res_ML)) %>%
    filter(! is.na(Res_ML))
  rlm <- mblm(logval ~ Sample_Year, data = tmp)
  lmods[[metal]] <- rlm
}

mods$rlm <- lmods
rm(lmods, rlm, tmp, metal)
```

The structure of the summaries and coefficients are similar to `lm()`, so we can
use similar code to extract the details we want. Statistical significance here
is based on wilcox.test, which may not be entirely appropriate.  An alternative
test can be based on Kendal's Tau follows.

## Identify "Significant" Regressions with Wilcoxon Test
We choose not to rely on the significance test produced by the `summary.mblm()`
function.  It is based on  `wilcox.test()`, which is a rank test procedure, thus
ignoring magnitudes entirely.  It has been criticized in the literature, and is
even subtly put down in the `summary.mblm()` documentation.

In our setting, `wilcox.test()` identifies many more significant patterns than
do traditional linear models. However many of the estimates slopes are quite low
(data not shown).

A better conceptual match for testing the significance of the TS slope estimates
is Kendall's Tau, which is appropriate in this setting, with only a single 
predictor.

## T-S Slopes
```{r}
rlm_slopes <- unlist(lapply(mods$rlm ,function(m) coefficients(m)[[2]]))
names(rlm_slopes) <- mods$Parameter
```

## Significance Test with Kendall's Tau
We use p < 0.05, since the a Theil-Sen analysis is less affected by underlying
distributions.
```{r}
mods <- mods %>%
  mutate(tau_test = 
           lapply(data,
                  function(df) cor.test(~ log(Res_ML) + Sample_Year,
                                        data = df,
                                        method = 'kendall')))
```

## Values of Tau
Tau functions (here) like a robust alternative to a correlation coefficient.
Negative values imply declining metals concentrations, just as 
negative slopes would.  
```{r}
tau =   unlist(lapply(mods$tau_test, function(t) t$estimate))
names(tau) <- mods$Parameter
```

```{r} 
tau_p_vals = lapply(mods$tau_test, function(t) t$p.value)
names(tau_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter

(sig_tau <- names(tau_p_vals[tau_p_vals<0.05]))
```

### Plot Tau vs. Robust Slope
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4}
tibble(tau = tau, slope = rlm_slopes) %>%

  ggplot(aes(tau, slope)) + geom_point(aes(color = tau_p_vals < 0.05)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = 'gray') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = 'gray') +
  geom_text(aes(label = mods$Parameter), hjust = 0,
            nudge_x = .005, nudge_y = -0.0005) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.2, 0)) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10)
```

So, we now end up with Cadmium increasing, Chromium, Lead, and Nickel and Zinc
declining. Mercury is the only metal that shows different direction of change
under the two tests, and Selenium has small tau, but large slope. None of the
metals with significant changes are inconsistent.

Selenium shows no trend, although it showed a decline under linear
regression.  This analysis is preferable, since Selenium had many missing
values.  But even here, because of ties or near ties, we should not take p 
values too seriously.

Similarities between results under linear regression and robust regression give
some confidence that model results are not strongly influenced by model choice.

Still, a more careful analysis might:  
1.  Test alternate GLMs that handle heavily skewed data, or  
2.  Use permutation tests to generate confidence intervals and "p values"  

Since our main purpose is development of graphics and table, these steps are not
strictly necessary here.

# ANOVA (Ordered Factor) Analysis 
## Era Model
We can implement a similar model, fitting Eras instead of Sample_Years, by
fitting an ordered factor.  The default coding for an ordered factor splits the
fit into linear and quadratic terms, which here is appropriate. One should be
aware, however, that the coding with only three levels of an ordered factor
contrasts the first and third levels, effectively ignoring the intermediate one.
Whether you consider that a feature or a bug, will depend on your perspective.
Under a similar linear model, deviations from linear trend become part of the 
error term.  Here, it is fit as part of the quadratic term.

Our focus is on saying whether there are long term trends, so we are principally
interested in the linear term. 
```{r}
mods <- mods %>%
  mutate(era_anova = lapply(data,
                      function(df) lm(log(Res_ML) ~ Era, data = df)))
```

Again, because of the non-normal distribution of error, we rely on p < 0.025
as  "poor man's check" on potential problems with estimating p values.
```{r}
era_p_vals <- lapply(mods$era_anova ,function(m) summary(m)$coefficients[2,4])
names(era_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter

sig_era <- names(era_p_vals[era_p_vals<0.025])

era_slopes <- lapply(mods$era_anova ,function(m) coefficients(m)[[2]])
names(era_slopes) <- mods$Parameter
era_slopes[sig_era]
```

That list should look familiar.  It's the same list  as we found with a
normal linear regression.

## Region Model
We compare results from standard ANOVA, which assumes uniform variances, and 
Welch's ANOVA, which does not.
```{r}
mods <- mods %>%
  mutate(region_anova = lapply(data,
                      function(df) lm(log(Res_ML) ~ Region, data = df)),
         region_welch = lapply(data,
                      function(df) oneway.test(log(Res_ML) ~ Region, data = df)))
```
For the ANOVA we pull the p value from the ANOVA table, rather than the summary,
because we want to an overall test for inequality across all regions.
'summary.lm()` provides an array, but `anova.lm()` produces a data frame, with
non-syntactic variable names.

We start by examining just one metal, here Arsenic, to confirm that we can
extract the value we want.
```{r}
(a <- anova(mods$region_anova[[1]]))
cat('--------------------------------\n')
names(a)
a$`Pr(>F)`[1]
```

```{r}
(b <- mods$region_welch[[1]])
cat('--------------------------------\n')
names(b)
```

We use code similar to what we used above to extract p values for all models.
We get the same metals showing significant patterns regardless of which test
we use, which increases confidence in the general results.
```{r} 
region_p_vals = lapply(mods$region_anova, function(t) anova(t)$`Pr(>F)`[1])
names(region_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter

(sig_region <- names(region_p_vals[region_p_vals<0.025]))

welch_p_vals = lapply(mods$region_welch , function(t) t$p.value)
names(welch_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter

names(region_p_vals[welch_p_vals<0.025])
```

So almost all metals show differences by region, by both tests. We want to apply
a *post-hoc* test to each metal with significant regional differences to
highlight differences among regions. We use the `pairs.emmGrid()` function to do
so. By default, this uses Tukey's test.
```{r}
for (n in seq_along(mods$Parameter)) {
  metal <- mods$Parameter[n]
  #cat('\n--------------------', metal, '--------------------\n')
  emm <- emmeans(mods$region_anova[[n]], ~ Region, type = 'Response')
  #print(pairs(emm) )
  print(pwpp(emm, type = "response") + ggtitle(metal))
}
```

### Regional Comparison Summary
|Metal       | Comparison of Regions  |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------| 
|Arsenic     | Cape Small is low.                                         |
|Cadmium     | Outer Bay is low;  Cape Small is even lower.               |
|Chromium    | Cape Small is lower than East Bay and West Bay.            |
|Copper      | Outer Bay is low; Cape Small even lower.                   |
|Iron        | Cape Small is lower than East Bay and West Bay.            |
|Lead        | Cape Small is Low;  Inner Bay is high.                     |
|Mercury     | Cape Small < Outer Bay and West Bay < East Bay < Inner Bay |   
|Nickel      | Cape Small is Low.                                         |
|Silver      | Cape Small is Low; Inner Bay is high.                      |
|Zinc        | Cape Small is Low. Outer Bay lower than inner Bay.         |

## Stepwise Model Selection
We use stepwise model selection by AIC, using the `step()` function.

We could not get the following to work inside a pipe or `lapply()` call, so we
fell back on using a loop.
```{r}
lmods <- list()
for (n in seq_along(mods$region_anova)) {
  metal <- mods$Parameter[n]
  tmp <- metals_data %>%
    filter(Parameter == metal)
  mod <- lm(log(Res_ML) ~ Era * Region, data = tmp)
  mod2 <- step(mod, trace = FALSE, direction = 'both')
  lmods[[metal]] <- mod2
}
mods$step_anova <- lmods
rm(lmods, tmp, mod, mod2)
```

Here are the final, selected models.  Era (both linear and quadratic terms ) are
selected in most of the models.
```{r}
lapply(mods$step_anova, function(x) x$call)
```
```{r}
mods$Parameter
```

We want to look at the second row of the coefficient table for those models
that included an "Era" term.

```{r}
(a <- lapply(mods$step_anova,
               function(m) 'Era' %in% attr(terms(m), 'term.labels')))
```
```{r}
sig_list <- mods$Parameter[as_vector(a)]
sig_list
```

## Extract Temporal Trends
```{r}
for (p in sig_list) {
  row <- mods[mods$Parameter == p,]
  m <-  row$step_anova[[1]]
  cat(p,'\n')
  print(summary(m)$coefficients[2,c(1,4)])
}
```
Note that cadmium and silver are included here, because the Era term was retained
in the best model by stepwise methods, but the linear term is not significant.

All metals with significant trends were declining.

## Statistical Significance of Temporal Trend
This only tests the significance of the linear main effect, not interactions or
the quadratic term for Era.  The only models fit with an important interaction
were for lead and silver, so we  handle them as special cases in a moment.
```{r}
step_p_vals <- lapply(mods$step_anova ,function(m) summary(m)$coefficients[2,4])
names(step_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter

sig_step <- names(step_p_vals[step_p_vals<0.025])
sig_step
```

### What's up with Lead and Silver
Note that Lead is the only that selects a model with a significant interaction.
```{r}
pb_dat <- metals_data %>%
  filter(Parameter == 'Lead')
pb_mod <- lm(formula = log(Res_ML) ~ Era * Region, data = pb_dat)
summary(pb_mod)
emmip(pb_mod, Region ~ Era, type = 'Response')
rm(pb_dat, pb_mod)
```

So, what we see is as RISE  followed by a DROP, except in Cape Small.  This is a
complex message to convey.  Overall, we see a decline (since the linear terms
are significant).  The exception is Cape Small, where there is no trend.
```{r}
ag_dat <- metals_data %>%
  filter(Parameter == 'Silver')
ag_mod <- lm(formula = log(Res_ML) ~ Era * Region, data = ag_dat)
summary(ag_mod)
emmip(ag_mod, Region ~ Era, type = 'Response')
rm(ag_dat, ag_mod)
```

The story for silver is a strong up and down pattern at all sites except 
West Bay, leading to a significant quadratic (but not linear) effect of Era.
Few interactions are significant. The only Region where a decline is possible is 
Cape Small, but eyeing the parameters (-0.045 - 0.503) = -0.548, with a standard 
error probably about 0.2, the drop is likely significant, but we don't pursue
a formal calculation to confirm).

# Mixed Effects Models
A mixed effects model abstracts long-term unexplained  differences among
sample locations (Substations) as sources of variation. We are not INTERESTED
in that variability, but we know it exists.  This model reduces the unexplained
variation in the model, improving sensitivity to other patterns.

## Mixed Effects Linear Regression
For our purposes, a linear regression makes better sense and uses available
data slightly more completely.
```{r}
lmods <- list()
for (n in seq_along(mods$region_anova)) {
  metal <- mods$Parameter[n]
  tmp <- metals_data %>%
    filter(Parameter == metal) %>%
    filter(! is.na(Res_ML))
  mod <- lme(fixed = log(Res_ML) ~ Sample_Year + Region,
             random = ~ 1 | Substation,
             data = tmp,
             method = 'REML',
             na.action = na.omit)
  lmods[[metal]] <- mod
}
mods$me_lr_mod <- lmods
rm(lmods, tmp, mod)
```

Extract significant slopes by this model.
```{r}
me_lr_p_vals <- lapply(mods$me_lr_mod,
               function(m) summary(m)$tTable[2,5])
names(me_lr_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter

me_lr_slopes <- lapply(mods$me_lr_mod,
               function(m) summary(m)$tTable[2,1])
names(me_lr_slopes) <- mods$Parameter
sig_me_lr <- names(me_lr_slopes[me_lr_p_vals<0.025])
me_lr_slopes[sig_me_lr]
```
By that test, we pick up a new matal with a declining pattern, Arsenic, and 
all significant changes except Cadmium are decreasing.

## Mixed Effects ANOVA
We implement a step-wise model selection strategy here as well.  We use 
`method = 'ML'` to ensure appropriate comparison of models by AIC with
`stepAIC()`.
```{r}
lmods <- list()
for (n in seq_along(mods$region_anova)) {
  metal <- mods$Parameter[n]
  tmp <- metals_data %>%
    filter(Parameter == metal) %>%
    filter(! is.na(Res_ML))
  mod <- lme(fixed = log(Res_ML) ~ Era * Region,
             random = ~ 1 | Substation,
             data = tmp,
             method = 'ML',
             na.action = na.omit)
  mod2 <- stepAIC(mod, trace = FALSE, direction = 'both')
  lmods[[metal]] <- mod2
}
mods$me_mod <- lmods
rm(lmods, tmp, mod, mod2)
```

### Selected Model Terms
(This is an alternative to extracting the call object that facilitates searching
for specific terms in the models via code.)
```{r}
lapply(mods$me_mod,
               function(m) attr(terms(m), 'term.labels'))
```
So by this model, ALL metals show temporal patterns (or at least AIC suggests
temporal terms are useful for prediction). However, not all models show 
significant linear trends.

In an lme summary object, the coefficients table is called 'tTable',
so we can pull statistically significant linear temporal trends, as before
```{r}
me_p_vals <- lapply(mods$me_mod,
               function(m) summary(m)$tTable[2,5])
names(me_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter
sig_me <- names(me_p_vals[me_p_vals<0.025])
sig_me
```
```{r}
me_slopes <- lapply(mods$me_mod,
               function(m) summary(m)$tTable[2,1])
names(me_slopes) <- mods$Parameter
me_slopes[me_p_vals<0.025]
```
However, for cadmium, lead and silver, that test leaves out any detail about
trends buried in the interaction terms.  We do not bother to review those in
detail here, since we will not use these results directly in SoCB.

# Review of Temporal Trends
## Regressions
*  Regression,
*  Kendall's Tau (standing in for the Robust Regression)
*  Mixed Effect Regression (questionable p values)

```{r}
sig_lms
sig_tau
sig_me_lr
```

*   Cadmium shows up as significant in the robust regression, and the mixed
    effects regression, but not the least squares linear model.  
    
*   Selenium is significant by least squares, but not by robust regression
    (But the selenium data is complicated by what appear to be big changes in 
    sensitivity of analytical methods in the 2010 era, so we will not report.)

*   The mixed effects regression pulls out more significant trends,
    including Arsenic, and Copper, which neither of the other linear models 
    pulled out.

#### Which Metals Show up in All?
```{r}
intersect(sig_lms,
          intersect(sig_tau,
                    sig_me_lr))
```

## ANOVAs
Looking at linear main effects terms only.  If we were going down this path,
we'd need to look at quadratic terms and interactions too.
```{r}
sig_era
sig_step
sig_me
```

Results are quite similar, with best models based on stepwise regression also
identifying linear trends for copper and mercury.

#### Which Metals Show up in All?
```{r}
intersect(sig_era,
          intersect(sig_step,
                    sig_me))
```

# Selection of Final Models to Report
We could go with any of several models to report results.

1.  Selenium data is suspect, so we do not report on Selenium at all (See "Selenium_reanalysis.Rmd").

2. Chromium, lead, nickel and zinc are identified by all models as showing 
   trends.

3. Robust linear regression adds Cadmium to that list.

4. Mixed effects analysis (two flavors) adds several more, including
   arsenic, copper and mercury, but results are fairly model-dependent.
   
5.  For simplicity and consistency we chose to present results of the robust 
    linear models as "closest" to a consensus of all models.
