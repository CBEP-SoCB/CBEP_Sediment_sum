# Introduction
Casco Bay Estuary Partnership collected sediment samples in 1991, 1994, 2000,
2001, 2002, 2010, and 2011 to look at concentrations of toxic contaminants in
Casco Bay surface Sediments. These studies were complemented by data collected
by under the auspices of EPA's the National Coastal Assessment (NCA) and 
National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA).

Chemicals studied included metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, dioxins and furans,
and organotins.  These contaminants are all persistent in the marine
environment.

In this notebook, we conduct analyses of differences among our selected sums of
organic contaminants, principally by region.  This expands upon and double 
checks analysis of regions reported in "Sums_Trend_Analysis.Rmd".  We added it
to confirm patterns initially reported in State of Casco Bay that reviewers
found uncertain or confusing.

### Sums Data Caveates
Sums are defined in Table 4 of the Ramboll report, and summarized in the
'sumGroups.xlsx' file.

**The metadata is not entirely clear, but it appears (from examining the Access
database) that these sums omit non-detects, effectively equating non-detects to
zero. That is inconsistent with how we  handled non-detects in the other
toxics data sets. Omitting the non-detects in this way biases results upward,
with the effect larger when there are many non-detects.**

Many observations from 2010 and 2011 are zeros or NAs, because of high detection
limits. This is especially  problem for data on Pesticides, PCBs, and Butyltins
in 2010 and 2011.  Effectively, we have no data on PCBs and Pesticides, and very
little data on Butyltins from 2010 and 2011.

Because of different analytic methods used in different years, sums include a
relatively small consistent subset of parameters, so sums reported here may not 
be fully compatible with available benchmarks.

Ramboll standardized units in the Access database, so, most sums are expressed
in ng/g dry weight (~ ppb). The Dioxins and Furans are expressed in ng/kg, or
pg/g or approximately parts per trillion.  To simplify graphics, we re-express
the Dioxin and Furan values in PPB, below.  

There are no SQuiRTs for Dioxins and Furans. Instead, Ramboll also expressed
them in TEQ -- Toxic equivalents.  Toxic equivalents provide a way to estimate the
cumulative toxic effect of a mixture of related chemicals by weighting each
compound by its relative toxic effect, compared to some reference compound
(conventionally TCDD).

### Change Factor Levels
```{r change_factor_levels}
sums_data <- sums_data %>%

  mutate(Parameter = factor(Parameter,
                            levels = c(
                              "Butyltin (mono+di+tri)",
                              "CDD/CDF (total)",
                              "Chlordane (total)",
                              "DDT+DDE+DDD (sum)",
                              "PAHs (High MW)",
                              "PAHs (Low MW)",
                              "PAHs (total)",
                              "PCBs (total)",
                              "Pesticides (total)"),
                            labels = c("Butyltins",
                                       "Dioxins and Furans",
                                       "Chlordanes",
                                       "DDT Residues",
                                       "High MW PAHs",
                                       "Low MW PAHs",
                                       "Total PAHs",
                                       "Total PCBs",
                                       "Pesticides"))) %>%
  mutate(LVL = factor(LVL, levels = c('Below ERL','Between ERL and ERM',
                                     'Above ERM'))) %>%
  mutate(Region = factor(Region, levels = c("Inner Bay",
                                            "West Bay",
                                            "East Bay",
                                            "Outer Bay",
                                            "Cape Small")))
```

### Delete Unused Parameters
To simplify presentation for State of Casco Bay, we will not report all totals.
we remove unused data here.
```{r unused_parms}
sums_data <- sums_data %>%
  filter(! Parameter %in% c("Chlordanes", "High MW PAHs",
                            "Low MW PAHs", "Pesticides")) %>%
  mutate(Parameter = factor(Parameter,
                            levels = c("Butyltins",
                                       "Dioxins and Furans",
                                       "Total PAHs",
                                       "Total PCBs",
                                       "DDT Residues"
                                       )))
```

### Reexpress Dioxins and Furans in PPB
```{r rescale_to_ppB}
sums_data <- sums_data %>%
  mutate(Result = if_else(Parameter == "Dioxins and Furans",
                          Result/1000,
                          Result))
```

# Define Color Scale
One reviewer pointed to possible confusion because of use of red as a color
for NA values, with a gray as one of our scale colors.  That came from use of
our `cbep_colors()` color function.  They suggested reversing those color
choices.  Another alternative would be to use a portion of our `cbep_colors2()`
function's sequential color range.  But the latter choice is complicated, as the
sequential colors are sometimes fairly similar, despite being spread out
on a luminance scale.

We follow the reviewer's suggestion, and create a color scale for these
graphics.

```{r define_colors}
# First line is not necessary, but we like to keep color formats consistent....
fb <- rgb(t(col2rgb('firebrick')), maxColorValue = 255)
tox_colors <- c(cbep_colors()[1:2], fb)
na_color <- cbep_colors()[3]
rm(fb)
```

#  Preliminary Graphics
```{r prelim_graphic}
sums_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Era, y = Result, color = LVL)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  scale_color_manual(name = '', values = tox_colors, na.value = na_color,
                     labels = c('Below ERL','Between ERL and ERM',
                                     'Above ERM', "No Reference Defined")) +
  
  facet_wrap(~Parameter) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  scale_y_log10(breaks = scales::trans_breaks("log10", function(x) 100^x),
              labels = scales::trans_format("log10",
                                            scales::math_format(10^.x)))
```

```{r prelimi_graphic_wide, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
sums_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Region, y = Result, color = LVL)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_wrap(~Parameter, ncol = 5, ) +
  
  scale_color_manual(name = '', values = tox_colors, na.value = na_color,
                     labels = c('Below ERL','Between ERL and ERM',
                                     'Above ERM', "No Reference Defined")) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  scale_y_log10(breaks = scales::trans_breaks("log10", function(x) 100^x),
              labels = scales::trans_format("log10", 
                                            scales::math_format(10^.x))) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

# Region Only ANOVA
We begin by looking at the simplest possible model, one that ignores sampling 
heterogeneity over time and space.   This is the model that Ramboll emphasized 
in their report.

We compare results from standard ANOVA, which assumes uniform variances, and 
Welch's ANOVA, which does not.

```{r}
mods <- sums_data %>%
  group_by(Parameter) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(region_anova = lapply(data,
                      function(df) lm(log(Result) ~ Region, data = df)),
         region_welch = lapply(data,
                      function(df) oneway.test(log(Result) ~ Region, 
                                               data = df)))
```

We extract p values for both models.

For the ANOVA we pull the p value from the ANOVA table, rather than the summary,
because we want to an overall test for inequality across all regions.
'summary.lm()` provides an array, but `anova.lm()` produces a data frame, with
non-syntactic variable names.

For Welch's Test, we directly pull a p value from the `htest` object returned
by the function call.

```{r} 
region_p_vals = lapply(mods$region_anova, function(t) anova(t)$`Pr(>F)`[1])
names(region_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter

welch_p_vals = lapply(mods$region_welch , function(t) t$p.value)
names(welch_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter
```

### Welches ANOVA
```{r}
welch_p_vals
```
All show significant regional patterns.  Unfortunately, there is no easy way to
examine pairwise comparisons among groups using the Welch's Test, as what is 
returned is not a linear model, but an `htest` object, which is much more 
limited in terms of its contents.

The point here is that heterogeneity of variances is an issue with these data,
although there is little we can do about it at this point, except be aware and 
treat all reported p values as somewhat suspect.

### Standard ANOVA
```{r}
region_p_vals
```

All EXCEPT Dioxins and Furans show significant regional patterns, and even 
Dioxins and Furans are close to significant.

```{r}
for (n in seq_along(mods$Parameter)) {
  param <- mods$Parameter[n]
  emm <- emmeans(mods$region_anova[[n]], ~ Region, type = 'Response')
  print(pwpp(emm, type = "response") + ggtitle(param))
}
```

So, by this model:  

Parameter          |    Result  
-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------  
Butyltins          |  Cape Small < Inner Bay  
DDT Residues       |  Cape Small < West Bay, Outer Bay, East Bay < Inner Bay  
Dioxins and Furans |  No differences among regions  
Total PAHs         |  Cape Small and West Bay < East Bay and Inner Bay; Cape Small < Outer Bay  
Total PCBs         |  Cape Small < Outer Bay, East Bay and Inner Bay; West Bay < Inner Bay; Outer Bay < Inner bay  


# Linear Regression Model
The first way we can incorporate differences in time is to fit a linear 
regression that accounts for when samples were collected.  Note that this fits 
ONLY a linear term, and thus dos not fully account for differences in
sampling history between Eras. We have no reason to believe differences
by when sampling occurred are linear for all parameters.

```{r}
mods <- mods %>%
  mutate(lr_mod = lapply(data,
                      function(df) lm(log(Result) ~ Sample_Year * Region, 
                                      data = df)))
```

```{r}
mods$Parameter
lapply(mods$lr_mod,anova)
```

So Regions are statistically significant for all the regression models, even
though we did not fit a quadratic term. Interactions are not significant. We
replace all models with simpler, non-interaction models.

## Refit Without Interaction
```{r}
mods <- mods %>%
 mutate(lr_mod = lapply(data,
                      function(df) lm(log(Result) ~ Sample_Year + Region, 
                                      data = df)))
```

```{r}
mods$Parameter
cat('\n-----------------------------\n')
lapply(mods$lr_mod,anova)
```
So region is statistically Significant for all Parameters.

## Extract Marginal Means
```{r}
mods <- mods %>%
 mutate(lr_emms = lapply(lr_mod, 
                         function(m) emmeans(m, pairwise ~ Region, 
                                             at= list(Year = 2000),
                                             )))
```

```{r}
for (p in mods$Parameter) {
  row  = mods[mods$Parameter == p,]
  print(plot(row$lr_emms[[1]]) + ggtitle(p))
}
```

## Alteratively, Plot Pairwise Comparisons
```{r}
for (p in mods$Parameter) {
  row  <- mods[mods$Parameter == p,]
  emm <- emmeans(row$lr_mod[[1]], ~ Region, type = 'Response')
  print(pwpp(emm, type = "response") + ggtitle(p))
}
```

So, by this model:

Parameter          |    Result  
-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------  
Butyltins          |  No differences between regions  
DDT Residues       |  Cape Small < other regions < Inner bay  
Dioxins and Furans |  No differences among regions  
Total PAHs         |  Cape Small < Outer Bay and West Bay < East Bay and Inner Bay  
Total PCBs         |  Cape Small < Other regions < Inner bay; West Bay < East Bay

# Two-Way ANOVA (Ordered Factor) Analysis 
## Stepwise Model Selection
We used stepwise model selection by AIC, using the `step()` function to identify
whether we needed interaction terms in any of our ANOVA models.  All interaction
terms were omitted.  The "best" model (BY AIC) for all parameters except 
DDT residues included Region and Era terms.  For DDT, the  "Best" Model omitted 
the Era Term.  The stepwise analysis is not shown.  This is similar to what we 
observed with the regression models.

The default ordered factor analysis with three ordered factors effectively fits 
a linear relationship between the first and third levels of the factor (here 
"Era") and an adjustment term to fit the middle (second) level of the factor.
Thus this model is better able to fitting data to the different Eras than the 
regression model we explored previously.

## Fit Two Way Models
```{r}
mods <- mods %>%
  mutate(two_way_anova = lapply(data,
                      function(df) lm(log(Result) ~ Region + Era, data = df)))

two_way_p_vals = lapply(mods$two_way_anova, function(t) anova(t)$`Pr(>F)`[1])
names(two_way_p_vals) <- mods$Parameter
two_way_p_vals
```

The "Region" term is significant for all models.

```{r}
for (n in seq_along(mods$Parameter)) {
  param <- mods$Parameter[n]
  emm <- emmeans(mods$two_way_anova[[n]], ~ Region, type = 'Response')
  print(pwpp(emm, type = "response") + ggtitle(param))
}
```

So, by this model:  

Parameter          |    Result  
-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------  
Butyltins          |  No Differences  
DDT Residues       |  Cape Small < Others < Inner Bay  
Dioxins and Furans |  Cape Small and West Bay < Inner Bay; Cape Small < East Bay  
Total PAHs         |  Cape Small < Others; West Bay < East Bay and Inner Bay; Outer Bay < Inner Bay  
Total PCBs         |  Cape Small < Others;  West Bay < East Bay and Inner Bay; Outer Bay < Inner Bay  

## Model Diagnostics
We know from other analyses that these models are adequate, but that the
data violates some model assumptions.  

We include this here for completeness.
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
for (n in seq_along(mods$Parameter)) {
  param <- mods$Parameter[n]
  mod <- mods$two_way_anova[[n]]
  plot(mod)
  title(param, line = 1.25)
}
par <- oldpar
```

Most models fit acceptably, but with an outlier or two.  Most distributions
have heavy tails, but are not badly skewed.  None of the outliers have high
leverage.  There is some tendency for the errors to be larger on sites with
lower predicted values.  Given decent sample sizes, none of these problems
is fatal, but they are worth remembering, as they mean p values are at best
approximate.

# LMER Models
We fit a mixed effects model in which we treat sampling locations as random
factors.  Formally, the data are repeated measures samples, to the extent that
we resample at similar locations.  "Substations" were defined as samples
collected within about 100 meters of each other in subsequent years.  These
models provide the most stringent analysis using available data.

```{r}
mods <- mods %>%
  mutate(two_way_lmer = lapply(data,
                      function(df) lme(fixed = log(Result) ~ Region + Era, 
                                       random =   ~ 1 | Substation,
                                       data = df,
                                       method = 'REML',
                                       na.action = na.omit)))
```

```{r}
for (n in seq_along(mods$Parameter)) {
  param <- mods$Parameter[n]
  emm <- emmeans(mods$two_way_lmer[[n]], ~ Region, type = 'Response')
  print(pwpp(emm, type = "response") + ggtitle(param))
}
```

So, by this model:  

Parameter          |    Result  
-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------  
Butyltins          |  No Differences  
DDT Residues       |  Cape Small < Others < Inner Bay    
Dioxins and Furans |  No Differences  
Total PAHs         |  Cape Small < Others; West Bay < East Bay and Inner Bay; Outer Bay < Inner Bay   
Total PCBs         |  Cape Small < Others;  West Bay < East Bay and Inner Bay; Outer Bay < Inner Bay  


# Discussion
This analysis produces **LARGELY** consistent results regardless of the model.
Pairwise comparisons are always tricky, as different models will identify
different significant pairs.  here some models dissect the pairwise comparisons
into more subdivisions but the general message remains the same.

1. Differences among regions for Butyltins and Dioxins and Furans depend on the 
model;  When they are found, they are close to statistical significance, and
thus somewhat untrustworthy, given known model pathologies. The robust conclusion
is probably to report no pairwise differences.

2.  Consistently,and for all parameters, Cape Small has lowest concentrations of contaminants.

3.  Consistently, the Inner Bay has the highest levels of contaminants.

4.  The subtlety revolves around which other areas sometimes show higher levels.
    East Bay is often higher than West Bay.
