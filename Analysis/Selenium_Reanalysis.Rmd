# Introduction
Casco Bay Estuary Partnership collected sediment samples in 1991, 1994, 2000,
2001, 2002, 2010, and 2011 to look at concentrations of toxic contaminants in
Casco Bay surface Sediments. These studies were complemented by data collected
by under the auspices of EPA's the National Coastal Assessment (NCA) and 
National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA).

Chemicals studied included metals. Here we analyze long-term trends in Selenium.

Lauren Brown, from Ramboll Scientific was kind enough to review a draft of the
Toxics chapter for State of Casco Bay.  

She questioned some of our conclusions about selenium, which differed from what 
Ramboll reported.  Here, we reanalyze the Selenium data to
clarify what we and Ramboll found.

Our guess is that differences reflect different analytic choices, but it would be
good to confirm what is going on.


The comments from Brown in her review was as follows:

1. Double check selenium trend. 2010/11 concentrations appear higher than the
   two previous sampling events. From the Ramboll report:

>  For selenium, the significantly higher concentrations in the 2010–2011 data
   are due to higher concentrations    reported in four of the five regions, but
   most notably in West Bay and East Bay (Appendix A, Figure A-37). Minimum
   detected selenium concentrations are similar in all three sampling events,
   less than 0.08 µg/g in all cases, but the maximum concentration in the
   2010-2011 data exceeds those from the previous sampling by a factor of nearly
   three (e.g., 1.1 µg/g and 1.2 µg/g in 1991/1994 and 2000–2002, respectively,
   and 2.9 µg/g in 2010–2011) . Although this same trend was not apparent for
   most metals in this dataset, the apparent increase in selenium concentrations
   is confounded by differences in analytical methods.   Therefore, it is
   possible that the differences among sampling periods could be due to
   differences in efficiencies between the different analytical methods used in
   each round of sampling or they could represent significantly higher
   concentrations of selenium throughout much of Casco Bay, particularly in the
   East Bay.

2.  Double check selenium regions. I think Cape Small is low and East Bay is
    high based on Ramboll report. (Showing graphic).
    
Note that a key difference between Ramboll's analysis and ours is the handling
of non-detects.  Ramboll dropped non-detects from consideration.  In our primary
analysis we used a maximum likelihood method to estimate the expected value of 
the (unobserved) non-detects, based on some distributional assumptions 
(specifically,that the data are distributed approximately lognormal).  Here we 
make a more conservative assumption, and replace the non-detects with their 
detection limits.

The core finding is that our conclusions depend on whether we include 
non-detects in the analysis or not.  Non-detects were common in 2010 and 2011.
Ramboll's decision to omit them biased their statistical analysis.  But more 
importantly, data from the 2010s looks qualitatively different from  earlier
data in ways that suggest changes in laboratory practices are probably 
important.  In effect, analysis of the 2010 era Selenium data may not be a good
idea.

Throughout the following, we reprise our core statistical analyses on the 
selenium data, repeating all analyses both omitting the non-detects, and
including them at the detection limits.

                             "Chromium",
                             Parameter))
```

### Units
See the "Review_Data.Rmd" for details.

Ramboll Standardized units in the Access database, so, concentrations of metals
are expressed in $\mu g/g$ dry weight (~ ppm).

## Change Factor Levels
```{r}
metals_data <- metals_data %>%
  mutate(LVL = factor(LVL, levels = c('Below ERL','Between ERL and ERM',
                                     'Above ERM'))) %>%
  mutate(Region = factor(Region, levels = c("Inner Bay",
                                            "West Bay",
                                            "East Bay",
                                            "Outer Bay",
                                            "Cape Small"))) %>%
  mutate(Era = ordered(Era, levels = c( "1990s", "2000s", "2010s" )))
```

## Select Selenium Data
```{r}
metals_data <- metals_data %>%
  filter(Parameter == 'Selenium') %>%
  select(-Parameter)
```

## Replace Non-detects with Detection Limits
```{r}
metals_data <- metals_data %>%
  mutate(nd_to_dl = if_else(nd_flag, MDL, Result))
```


# Plot  Selenium 
## Without Non-detects
```{r trend_graph_wo_nd}
metals_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sample_Year, Result)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = Det_Flag), width = 0.1, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()[2:3]) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

## With the Non Detects
```{r trend_graph}
metals_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sample_Year, nd_to_dl)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = Det_Flag), width = 0.1, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()[2:3]) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```
Non-detects only occurred in the 2010s era, and they have a large effect on the
slope of the trend over time.  

So what is clear any trend in selenium depends on how one handles the 
non-detects.  Omitting the non-detects generates an nominal INCREASE in
concentrations.  Including them at the method detection limit (shown) or at the 
maximum likelihood estimator (preferred, but not shown) results in finding 
a nominal DECREASE.

```{r era_box_wo_nd}
metals_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = Result, x = Era)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10()
  
```
```{r era_box}
metals_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = nd_to_dl, x = Era)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10()
  
```

So what we see is that a simple regression or anova will, again, see very 
different results depending on how you handle non-detects.  This, obviously,
does not generate great confidence in the results.  Also, we end up with a 
serious problem with inhomogeneity of variances....

```{r region_jitter_wo_nd}
metals_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = Result, x = Region, color = Era)) +
  geom_jitter(width = .3, height = 0) +
  scale_y_log10()
  
```

```{r region_jitter}
metals_data %>%
 ggplot(aes(y = nd_to_dl, x = Region, color = Era)) +
  geom_jitter(width = .3, height = 0) +
  scale_y_log10()
  
```
The 2010s era data stands out as quite different, with both many higher 
observations and many more non-detects.

# Linear Regression
On log-transformed data.

## Without the Non Detects
```{r}
lr_mod_no_ND = lm(log(Result) ~ Sample_Year, data = metals_data)
anova(lr_mod_no_ND)
summary(lr_mod_no_ND)
```

That shows a statistically significant increase in concentrations over time.

## With the Non Detects
Let's look at a regression where the non-detects are included in the model at
the detection limit.
```{r}
lr_mod = lm(log(nd_to_dl) ~ Sample_Year, data = metals_data)
anova(lr_mod)
summary(lr_mod)
```
That shows a statistically significant decrease over time.

## Model Diagnostic Plots
```{r diagnostics}
oldpar <- par()
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(lr_mod)
par(oldpar)
```

The model diagnostic plots are not great.  We have a cluster of points  at the
detection limits, and clear increase in variance for the lowest predicted values 
-- those from 2010 in this model.

# Robust Regression
We can conduct a robust regression, based on Theil-Sen slope estimators, or
(nearly equivalently) Kendall's Tau.

We could not get the following to work inside a pipe or `lapply()` call, so we
fell back on using a loop.  Also, `mblm()` does not like having a log transform
in the model formula, so we had to move the log transform outside the call.
## Without the Non Detects
```{r}
tmp <- metals_data %>%
    mutate(logres = log(Result)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(logres))

rlm_no_ND <- mblm(logres ~ Sample_Year, data = tmp)
summary(rlm_no_ND)
```

## With the Non Detects
```{r}
tmp <- metals_data %>%
    mutate(logval = log(nd_to_dl)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(logval))
rlm <- mblm(logval ~ Sample_Year, data = tmp)
rm(tmp)
summary(rlm)
```

So we see the same relationship, even with a resistant regression.  The 
conclusion depends on how you handle the non-detects.

# ANOVA (Ordered Factor) Analysis 
## Era Model
We can implement a similar model, fitting Eras instead of Sample_Years, by
fitting an ordered factor.  The default coding for an ordered factor splits the
fit into linear and quadratic terms, which here is appropriate. One should be
aware, however, that the coding with only three levels of an ordered factor
contrasts the first and third levels, effectively ignoring the intermediate one.
Whether you consider that a feature or a bug, will depend on your perspective.
Under a similar linear model, deviations from linear trend become part of the 
error term.  Here, it is fit as part of the quadratic term.

Our focus is on saying whether there are long term trends, so we are principally
interested in the linear term. 

```{r}
era_anova_no_ND = lm(log(Result) ~ Era, data = metals_data)
summary(era_anova_no_ND)
```

### With the Non Detects
```{r}
era_anova = lm(log(nd_to_dl) ~ Era, data = metals_data)
summary(era_anova)
```

So again, we see a difference in the sign of the linear trend term, 
depending on how you handle the non-detects.

## Region Model
### Standard ANOVA
We compare results from standard ANOVA, which assumes uniform variances, and 
Welch's ANOVA, which does not.
#### Without the Non Detects
```{r}
region_anova_no_ND = lm(log(Result) ~ Region, data = metals_data)
summary(region_anova_no_ND)

```

#### With the Non Detects
```{r}
region_anova = lm(log(nd_to_dl) ~ Region, data = metals_data)
summary(region_anova)
```

### Welch's Test
This  does not assume homogeneity of variances.

#### Without the Non Detects
```{r}
region_welch_no_ND = oneway.test(log(Result) ~ Region, data = metals_data)

region_welch_no_ND
```

#### With the Non Detects
```{r}

region_welch = oneway.test(log(nd_to_dl) ~ Region, data = metals_data)

region_welch
```

So again, we see contradictory results of ANOVA depending on how we address the 
non-detects.

## Stepwise Model Selection
### Without the Non Detects
```{r}
  mod <- lm(log(Result) ~ Era * Region, data = metals_data)
  mod2 <- step(mod, trace = FALSE, direction = 'both')

  mod2$call
  anova(mod2)
  summary(mod2)
```
  So `step()` drops the interaction term but retains both the main effects.


### With the Non Detects
```{r}
  mod <- lm(log(nd_to_dl) ~ Era * Region, data = metals_data)
  mod2 <- step(mod, trace = FALSE, direction = 'both')

  mod2$call
  anova(mod2)
  summary(mod2)
```
So, what we see is that if we retain the non-detects, the slope of the trend is
negative and differences between regions are marginally significant.

# Mixed Effects Models
A mixed effects model abstracts long-term unexplained  differences among
sample locations (Substations) as sources of variation. We are not INTERESTED
in that variability, but we know it exists.  This model reduces the unexplained
variation in the model, improving sensitivity to other patterns.

## Mixed Effects Linear Regression
For our purposes, a linear regression makes better sense and uses available
data slightly more completely.

### Without the Non Detects
```{r}
mod <- lme(fixed = log(Result) ~ Sample_Year + Region,
             random = ~ 1 | Substation,
             data = metals_data,
             method = 'REML',
             na.action = na.omit)
anova(mod)
```

```{r}
summary(mod)
```

### With the Non Detects
```{r}
mod <- lme(fixed = log(nd_to_dl) ~ Sample_Year + Region,
             random = ~ 1 | Substation,
             data = metals_data,
             method = 'REML',
             na.action = na.omit)
anova(mod)
```

```{r}
summary(mod)
```

## Mixed Effects ANOVA
### Without the Non Detects
```{r}
mod <- lme(fixed = log(Result) ~ Era + Region,
             random = ~ 1 | Substation,
             data = metals_data,
             method = 'REML',
             na.action = na.omit)
anova(mod)
```

```{r}
summary(mod)
```

## With the Non Detects
```{r}
mod <- lme(fixed = log(nd_to_dl) ~ Era + Region,
             random = ~ 1 | Substation,
             data = metals_data,
             method = 'REML',
             na.action = na.omit)
summary(mod)
```
