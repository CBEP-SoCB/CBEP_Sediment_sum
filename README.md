Analysis of concentration of contaminants in Casco Bay sediment samples
1991 - 2011.

# Introduction
Casco Bay Estuary Partnership collected sediment samples in 1991, 1994, 2000,
2001, 2002, 2010, and 2011 to look at concentrations of toxic contaminants in
Casco Bay surface Sediments. These studies were complemented by data collected
under the auspices of EPA's National Coastal Assessment (NCA) and 
National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA).

Chemicals studied included metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, dioxins and furans,
and organotins.  These contaminants are all persistent in the marine
environment.

This repository provides access to the underlying data and the related data
analysis code that underlies the most reent State of Casco Bay (SoCB) Report.

# Statement of Purpose
CBEP is committed to the ideal of open science.  Our State of the Bay data
archives ensure the science underlying the 2020/2021 State of Casco Bay report
is documented and reproducible by others. The purpose of these archives is to
release  data and data analysis code whenever possible to allow others to
review, critique, learn from, and build upon CBEP science.

# Archive Structure
CBEP 2020/2021 State of the Bay data analysis summaries contain a selection of 
data,  data analysis code, and visualization code as used to produce 
results shared via our most recent State of Casco Bay report. Usually, these
archives are organized into two or three folders, including the following:

- `Data`  folder.  Contains data in simplified or derived form as used in our
data  analysis.  Associated metadata is contained in related Markdown documents,
usually `DATA_SOURCES.md` and `DATA_NOTES.md`.

- Analysis.  Contains one or more R Notebooks proceeding through the principal
data analysis steps that underpin SoCB reporting. To simplify the archives,
much preliminary analysis, and many analysis "dead ends" have been omitted. 

- Graphics.  Contains R Notebooks stepping through development of graphics, and
also copies of resulting graphics, usually in \*.png and \*.pdf formats.  These
graphics may differ from graphics as they appear in final State of the Bay
graphical layouts. Again, most draft versions of graphics have been omitted for 
clarity.
